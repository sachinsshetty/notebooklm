The Challenge

Build a voice-controlled AI agent that autonomously completes real-world tasks from start to finish. Your agent must understand complex requests, plan multi-step actions, and execute them independently through API integrations.

Requirements

Voice Interface: Natural language understanding with context-aware conversation

Task Execution: Complete end-to-end workflows across multiple services

Integration: Connect with at least 2 external APIs

Autonomy: Make decisions, handle errors, and ask for clarification when needed


Example - 
1. Travel Coordinator
User: "Book me a trip to Austin for the AI conference next month. I need a flight, hotel near the convention center, and ground transportation."
Agent Actions: Search flights, compare options, book tickets, find nearby hotels, make reservations, arrange airport transfers, add to calendar, send confirmations


2. Dinner Party Assistant
User: "I'm hosting 8 people for dinner Saturday. Two are vegetarian. Plan the menu and get everything delivered."
Agent Actions: Suggest recipes based on dietary restrictions, calculate quantities, create shopping list, place grocery order, schedule delivery, set cooking reminders, text guests for allergies

3. Meeting Scheduler
*User*: "Set up our quarterly review with the product team. Find a 2-hour slot that works for everyone and book the main conference room."
*Agent Actions*: Check 6 calendars for availability, find optimal time slots, book conference room, send calendar invites, create agenda template, order catering if needed, send reminder 24 hours before
